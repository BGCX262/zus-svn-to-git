Hi, 
 you can use your theme at your OWN risk :)
There's a lot of mess inside i know, but i don't have time to work on this theme and you probably want to use it now :)

If you want to became a developer please contact me at giovanni@rovato.org, you can (maybe) find new versions at http://code.google.com/p/zus/

You'll need these plugins:
- the_excerpt_reloaded
- get recent comments
- wp_email (mine is not working propely)

Every category has it's own space:
- central part: cat 1
- small col on the left-central part: cat 2
- central-bottom: cat 3
- right #1: cat 4
- right #2: cat 5
- right #3: cat 6


Please leave the credits in the footer :)
